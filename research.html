				My dissertation shows that in light of his own theory of obligation as obedience to the laws, Thomas Hobbes was liberated by the regicide of 1649 to undermine religious authorities that in his earlier writings he had been duty-bound to defend. I have published chapter one as an article in The Historical Journal, entitled “Hobbes’s Changing Ecclesiology.” The subsequent chapters further elaborate the political theoretical implications of my argument for thinking about liberty and authority. 
				<br> 
				<br>
				I argue that Hobbes is uniquely difficult to taxonomize in relation to liberalism because he advanced a rhetorical anti-liberalism that sought to manipulate our affective orientation towards individual liberty, even as he developed key liberal concepts such as negative liberty and natural rights. I am currently writing an essay on the development of the liberal concept of liberty, which reflects on the irony that the central concept of liberal political theory originated in a rhetorical effort to render that very concept a peripheral value.

				I have also written op-eds on U.S. domestic politics and foreign policy, which you can read.
