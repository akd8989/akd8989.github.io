				I designed and teach my own course at Northwestern University for the prestigious academic-internship program Chicago Field Studies. I thus have extensive experience teaching small, intimate classes ranging from ten to eighteen students. The interdisciplinary course is entitled “The Modern Workplace” and explores the history and politics of working. From Tuesday through Friday, students work at downtown internships of their choosing. Every Monday we convene to reflect on the world of working. The course is seminar-style, although on some occasions I opt to lecture for roughly half of the three-hour session, in order to clarify difficult concepts or to elaborate the context of that week’s readings.
				<br>
				<br>
 
				My pedagogical goal each seminar is to facilitate discussion in such a way that it seems to arise organically from student engagement. By the end of the quarter, it genuinely does. For many students, the course is not only their first discussion-based seminar, but a first encounter with complex thinkers including Karl Marx, W.E.B. Du Bois, Hannah Arendt, and many others. Some students are initially hesitant to speak. To encourage them to do so, I establish at the outset that active participation is not only a component of their overall grade, but indispensable to the collective learning experience. I prepare meticulous, question-driven lesson plans each seminar, which allow me to get going the conversation, but from which I am eager to depart as I respond to student input. Students post weekly reading responses to an online class discussion board, and I sometimes privately encourage the shyer students to bring these responses into seminar discussion, so that everyone feels they are capable of making valuable contributions.
				 <br>
				<br>
				Maintaining student focus throughout a three-hour seminar is challenging, and I have developed some techniques to ensure that students remain engaged. I solicit student feedback regarding their enjoyment of each reading (or lack thereof), so that on future syllabi I can replace readings that fail to stimulate interest. Short video clips, such as interviews with authors we are reading, serve as primers for class discussion. Towards the end of every seminar, we let down our proverbial hair, and relate the day’s discussion to our own lives as workers and citizens.
				 <br>
				<br>
				Civic education is central to political science, which is why I continued teaching “The Modern Workplace” despite having fellowship funding and no teaching obligations. Undergraduate students of political science should not merely acquire rote knowledge about government, but enrich their capacities as democratic citizens. My course is continuously geared towards improving civic literacy, giving students the critical distance needed to survey economic institutions as sites of both collaboration and contest, as ladders to success but also as relationships of power. The course design, like my own research, blends the historical and the normative, the empirical and the critical. By reappraising what work is, students learn to reimagine what it can be.
				 <br>
				<br>
				In addition to continuing to teach “The Modern Workplace” for Northwestern, I will teach the course “Modern Political Thought” for Loyola University (Chicago) during the Spring semester of 2021. This course will explore the history of political philosophy from the High Renaissance to the 19th Century. The course will have approximately thirty-five students.
